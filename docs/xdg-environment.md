# Environment variables & desktop portals

## Why

Three different mechanisms in this repo all shape "what an app sees when it
asks about the environment or the desktop" — a login-time env var file, a
systemd env var directory, and a D-Bus request broker. They look similar and
overlap in purpose, but apply at different moments to different sets of
processes. Mixing them up leads to "I set the var but the app doesn't see it"
confusion, so this doc keeps them straight.

| Layer                                       | Read by                              | When                                                | Scope                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`/etc/environment`](#etcenvironment)       | PAM (`pam_env`)                      | At login, before your session's process tree starts | Every login on the box — TTY, greetd/tuigreet, SSH — any PAM-based auth path                                                         |
| [`environment.d/*.conf`](#environmentd)     | `systemd --user` (via `pam_systemd`) | At systemd user-session startup                     | Anything spawned _through_ systemd-user or D-Bus — launchers, `.desktop` `Exec=`, dbus-activated services                            |
| [`xdg-desktop-portal`](#xdg-desktop-portal) | The portal daemon (D-Bus service)    | On-demand, per portal call                          | Not env vars — a broker for things Wayland apps can't do directly (screenshot, screen share, reading the system theme, file pickers) |

## `/etc/environment`

**Not chezmoi-managed** — this is a system file (see [`etc/environment`](../etc/environment)),
applied by hand (`sudo cp etc/environment /etc/environment`), same as
[greetd's config](greetd.md). Plain `KEY=VAL` lines, parsed once by PAM at
login and inherited the traditional Unix way by every child of your login
session. It's the only layer of the three that also covers plain TTY logins
and SSH — no desktop or systemd session required.

```sh
#QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct     # commented out — Qt apps would theme via qt5ct
#QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=kvantum      # commented out — force Qt apps onto the Kvantum theme engine
BROWSER=firefox                 # generic fallback some CLI tools/scripts use to open a URL
EDITOR=nano                     # default $EDITOR for git commit -e, crontab -e, etc.
```

The `QT_*` lines are commented out on purpose — uncomment them if a Qt app
(e.g. JetBrains Toolbox) ever needs explicit theming. `EDITOR`/`BROWSER` are
not overridden anywhere in the fish config, so `nano`/`firefox` are what
actually fires when a CLI tool asks for your editor or browser.

## `environment.d`

[systemd's environment mechanism](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/environment.d.html)
(`man environment.d`) — every `*.conf` under
[`home/dot_config/environment.d/`](../home/dot_config/environment.d/) is read
by `systemd --user` at session start and held as the user manager's merged
environment. This matters separately from `/etc/environment` because a lot of
desktop-launched apps (via `.desktop` files, portal-spawned helpers,
dbus-activated services) never go through fish — they'd never see a var only
set in `config.fish`, but they do see anything here.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`path.conf`](../home/dot_config/environment.d/path.conf)         | `PATH=${HOME}/.local/bin:...`                          | `${HOME}` because `environment.d` expands `${VAR}` env references, **not** `%` unit specifiers — `%h` stays a literal `%h` here (verify: `systemctl --user show-environment`). Without this, anything launched outside your interactive shell (e.g. a `.desktop` entry) wouldn't see `~/.local/bin` (where `claude` lives).                      |
| [`xdg.conf`](../home/dot_config/environment.d/xdg.conf)           | `XDG_DESKTOP_DIR`, `XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR`, etc.            | The env-var form of the same info in [`user-dirs.dirs`](../home/dot_config/user-dirs.dirs) — some apps read the env var directly instead of parsing that file, so this keeps both answers in sync. Uses `${HOME}` for the same reason as `path.conf` (a literal `%h` here sent `dot-screenrec`/`dot-screenshot` output to a stray `%h/` folder). |
| [`wayland.conf`](../home/dot_config/environment.d/wayland.conf)   | `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=niri`, `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland` | Tells apps/portals this is a niri session on Wayland — affects GTK's `GDK_BACKEND` auto-detection. Note: this alone does **not** make Electron render natively (see `electron.conf`).                                                                                                                                                            |
| [`electron.conf`](../home/dot_config/environment.d/electron.conf) | `ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=auto`                    | Makes Electron apps (VS Code, Slack, Teams, Discord) pick the Wayland Ozone backend instead of falling back to XWayland — the fix for blurry/janky rendering on scaled/rotated outputs. Chrome ignores it (not Electron) — see its `.desktop` override. See [vscode.md](vscode.md).                                                              |
| [`fcitx5.conf`](../home/dot_config/environment.d/fcitx5.conf)     | `QT_IM_MODULE`, `XMODIFIERS`                           | Routes text input through fcitx for X11/XWayland apps. `GTK_IM_MODULE` is deliberately omitted (Wayland GTK apps use `text-input`; setting it triggers fcitx's Wayland-Diagnose warning). Electron apps get Wayland IME via the per-app `--enable-wayland-ime` flag. See [fcitx5.md](fcitx5.md).                                                 |

`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`/`XDG_SESSION_TYPE` are set **again**, redundantly, in
niri's own `environment { }` block in
[`config.kdl.tmpl`](../home/dot_config/niri/config.kdl.tmpl) — that one only
scopes to processes niri itself spawns via `spawn-at-startup`, while
`wayland.conf` here covers the broader systemd-user/D-Bus-activated set. Both
agree, so the overlap is harmless; a `niri.conf` file that duplicated just
`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` a _third_ time was removed as pure redundancy.

## `xdg-desktop-portal`

Not an env var file — [`xdg-desktop-portal`](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal)
is a D-Bus service that brokers requests apps can't fulfill themselves under
Wayland's security model (no app can screenshot another app's window
directly). Screenshots, screen recording, file pickers, and **reading system
appearance settings** (dark/light mode, accent color) all go through it.

The daemon itself only routes — the actual work is done by **backend**
implementations (`xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` and `-gtk`, per
[packages.md](packages.md)), and
[`portals.conf`](../home/dot_config/xdg-desktop-portal/portals.conf)'s
`[preferred]` block says which backend handles which interface:

```ini
[preferred]
default=gnome                                     # fallback for any interface not listed below
org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Screenshot=gnome      # screenshots -> gnome backend
org.freedesktop.impl.portal.ScreenCast=gnome      # screen recording/sharing -> gnome backend
org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Settings=gtk          # dark/light mode, accent color, etc. -> gtk backend
```

> **Was `wlr` until the Noctalia v4→v5 move.** `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` was
> removed then (niri isn't wlroots-based; upstream routes screencast through the
> gnome portal — see [ADR 0017](adr/0017-migrate-noctalia-v4-to-v5.md)), but
> `portals.conf` was left pointing at the now-uninstalled `wlr` backend, which
> silently broke screen sharing until this was repointed to `gnome`.

- **`ScreenCast`/`Screenshot`=gnome** — `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` implements the
  screencast interface niri supports; it's the upstream-recommended backend for
  niri. (`dot-screenshot`/`dot-screenrec` capture directly via grim / KMS and
  don't use these portal interfaces — they matter for _apps_ that request a
  screenshot or a screen share, e.g. a browser call.)
- **`Settings=gtk`** — `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` implements the Settings
  interface by reading `gsettings` (`org.gnome.desktop.interface
  color-scheme`). This is the mechanism that lets portal-aware apps (Ghostty,
  Chrome, Zen, Discord, Teams) ask "am I in dark mode" without a GNOME session
  running. It is deliberately pinned to `gtk` (not `gnome`, which also implements
  Settings) to keep the darkman→gtk→apps path in [theme-sync.md](theme-sync.md)
  unchanged. Confirm it answers with:

  ```sh
  busctl --user call org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop \
    /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop org.freedesktop.portal.Settings Read ss \
    "org.freedesktop.appearance" "color-scheme"
  # -> v u 1    (1 = prefer-dark, 2 = prefer-light; "Requested setting not
  #             found" instead means the Settings backend is unassigned again)
  ```

## Troubleshooting

```sh
# What systemd-user actually exported for this session:
systemctl --user show-environment

# What a specific portal interface resolves to right now:
busctl --user call org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop \
  /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop org.freedesktop.portal.Settings Read ss \
  "org.freedesktop.appearance" "color-scheme"

# Which portal backend processes are actually running:
pgrep -fa xdg-desktop-portal
```
